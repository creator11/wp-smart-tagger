A fork from WP Auto Tagger (http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-auto-tagger/developers/)

### Description

This plugin uses the Yahoo YQL to suggest tags based on the post content. You have the option to automatically tags posts on save or get tag suggestions with a single click. WP Smart Tagger will not replace your existing tags.

1. Upload `smart-tagger.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it! You should now see an 'Smart Tagger' panel on the `Write Post` page sidebar.
